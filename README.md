# Azure Olympic Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for Olympic data using Microsoft Azure services. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of data ingestion, storage, transformation, analysis, and visualization of Olympic-related datasets.

## Architecture

![Project Architecture](https://github.com/rohitaragde/azure-de-olampics-data/blob/master/architecture.png)

The project leverages the following Azure services:

- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Power BI

Data flows through the following stages:
1. Data Source
2. Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory)
3. Raw Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2)
4. Data Transformation (Azure Databricks)
5. Transformed Data Storage (Azure Data Lake Gen2)
6. Analytics (Azure Synapse Analytics)
7. Visualization (Power BI and Tableau)

## Data Pipeline

The data ingestion pipeline in Azure Data Factory includes the following datasets:

- Athletes
- Coaches
- EntriesGender
- Medals
- Teams
